# Ignore macOS system files
.DS_Store

# Ignore files without any extension
# Explanation:
# - This pattern ignores files that do NOT have a dot in their name (thus no extension)
# - It matches files at any directory level

# Using a wildcard negation trick:
# First ignore everything, then exclude files with extensions

# Ignore all files
*

# But exclude directories (so folder contents can be checked individually)
!*/

# Exclude files with extensions (i.e., files that have at least one dot)
!*.*

!LICENSE
!Makefile

# Result: all files without extensions are ignored, all files with extensions are tracked
